            <h2>> President (May/June 2024 - Present)</h2>
            <p>I have recently taken on the position of president of the CyberWomen@Warwick branch. As our roles have just handed over, I have only represented the branch at 2 conferences under this role - CyberUK 2024 as an attendee and BSides Cheltenham 2024 as a speaker.
            </p>

            <h2>> Education Officer (May 2023 - May 2024)</h2>
            <p>
                As Education Officer for CyberWomen@Warwick, my main role was to lead the organisation and running of talks and workshops aimed at secondary school and sixth form students in the local area. These talks and workshops covered a variety of topics including cryptography, steganography and OSINT. Whenever the branch has recieved feedback on these workshops, it has been very positive which was reflected both during the actual workshops with student participation, as well as their reflections after the event.
            </p>
            <p>
                As well as these events for secondary school students, I have also been part of the organising committee for the 2nd CyberWomen national conference in October 2023. This conference was attended by over 250 people and had a variety of speakers in attendance. For more information, please visit the CyberWomen Groups website.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also during my time as Eduation Officer, I participated in the UK Cyber 9/12 Strategy Challenge 2024 on the BT Tower / in person track. My team - <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/hack-tothefuture/" target="_blank">Hack To The Future</a> was one of the semi-final teams and won the 'Most Engaged Team' award.
